    <h1>TypeScript Questions and Answers</h1>

    <h2>What is TypeScript?</h2>
    <p>TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.</p>

    <h2>What are the benefits of using TypeScript?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Static typing helps catch errors early during development.</li>
        <li>Improved code readability and maintainability.</li>
        <li>Enhanced IDE support with autocompletion and refactoring tools.</li>
        <li>Compatibility with existing JavaScript code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How do you install TypeScript?</h2>
    <p>You can install TypeScript globally using npm with the following command:</p>
    <pre><code>npm install -g typescript</code></pre>

    <h2>What is a .ts file?</h2>
    <p>A .ts file is a TypeScript file that contains TypeScript code. It is transpiled into JavaScript for execution in browsers or Node.js.</p>

    <h2>How do you compile TypeScript code?</h2>
    <p>Use the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile .ts files into .js files. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>tsc filename.ts</code></pre>

    <h2>What is the difference between TypeScript and JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features, while JavaScript is a dynamic, loosely typed language.</p>

    <h2>TypeScript Interview Questions and Answers</h2>

    <h3>What are TypeScript's key features?</h3>
    <p>TypeScript offers static typing, interfaces, classes, and modules, which enhance JavaScript development.</p>

    <h3>What is the difference between an interface and a type in TypeScript?</h3>
    <p>Both are used for defining object shapes, but interfaces can be extended or implemented, while types are more flexible and can represent unions or intersections.</p>

    <h3>What is the purpose of TypeScript's "any" type?</h3>
    <p>The "any" type allows you to opt out of type checking for a variable, making it compatible with any type.</p>

    <h3>How does TypeScript handle null and undefined?</h3>
    <p>TypeScript has strict null checks enabled by default, requiring explicit handling of null and undefined values.</p>

    <h3>What is the difference between "unknown" and "any" in TypeScript?</h3>
    <p>The "unknown" type is safer than "any" because you must perform type checks before using it, while "any" bypasses type checking entirely.</p>

    <h3>How do you define a function in TypeScript?</h3>
    <p>You define a function with type annotations for its parameters and return value. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
}</code></pre>

    <h3>What is TypeScript's "readonly" modifier?</h3>
    <p>The "readonly" modifier ensures that a property cannot be reassigned after its initial assignment.</p>
