        <tr>
            <td>What is a primary key?</td>
            <td class="answer">A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>What is a foreign key?</td>
            <td class="answer">A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.</td>

            <td>What is an index?</td>
            <td class="answer">An index is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table at the cost of additional storage and maintenance overhead.</td>

            <td>What is a stored procedure?</td>
            <td class="answer">A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of SQL statements and optional control-of-flow statements, stored in the database and executed as a single unit.</td>

            <td>What is a trigger?</td>
            <td class="answer">A trigger is a database object that automatically executes a specified set of SQL statements in response to certain events on a table or view.</td>

            <td>What is a view?</td>
            <td class="answer">A view is a virtual table based on the result set of a SQL query, which can simplify complex queries and enhance security by restricting access to specific data.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>What is a transaction?</td>
            <td class="answer">A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work, ensuring data consistency and integrity.</td>

            <td>What is ACID in PostgreSQL?</td>
            <td class="answer">ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, which are the key properties that ensure reliable processing of database transactions.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Is PostgreSQL similar to SQL Server?</td>
            <td class="answer">PostgreSQL and SQL Server are both relational database management systems (RDBMS), but they differ in several ways. PostgreSQL is open-source, highly extensible, and cross-platform, while SQL Server is a proprietary product by Microsoft, primarily designed for Windows with enterprise-level support. Both are powerful, but the choice depends on specific requirements and ecosystem.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Is PostgreSQL similar to MongoDB?</td>
            <td class="answer">PostgreSQL and MongoDB are both database systems, but they are fundamentally different. PostgreSQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL and enforces a structured schema. MongoDB, on the other hand, is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, making it ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data. The choice between them depends on the application's data model and requirements.</td>
